# Customer Segmentation Using K-Means Clustering 🚀

This project aims to perform **customer segmentation** using **K-means clustering**. By segmenting customers based on their purchasing behavior and income, businesses can target specific customer groups more effectively for marketing campaigns and services. This README will walk you through the steps taken in the analysis, the data used, and the visualization of customer clusters.

## Overview 📝

Customer segmentation is a key marketing technique used to divide a customer base into groups that share similar characteristics, such as purchasing habits or demographics. In this project, we utilized **K-means clustering**, an unsupervised machine learning algorithm, to group customers based on their **Annual Income** and **Spending Score**.

The dataset for this project was sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shwetabh123/mall-customers) and contains details about customers of a mall, including demographic information, income levels, and spending scores. This project demonstrates how clustering can help better understand customer segments to enhance decision-making for targeted marketing.

## Dataset Information 📊

The dataset used in this project is the **Mall Customers** dataset, which contains the following attributes for each customer:

- **CustomerID**: A unique identifier for each customer.
- **Gender**: The gender of the customer (Male/Female).
- **Age**: The age of the customer.
- **Annual Income (k$)**: The annual income of the customer in thousands of dollars.
- **Spending Score (1-100)**: A score assigned to the customer based on their spending behavior in the mall (higher scores indicate more spending).

The focus of the clustering analysis is on the **Annual Income (k$)** and **Spending Score (1-100)** columns, as these features provide valuable insight into customer purchasing power and behavior.

## Project Workflow 🔄

1. **Data Preparation** 🗂️:

   - Load and explore the data using **Pandas**. The dataset is loaded from a CSV file, and initial exploration (e.g., using `.head()`) is done to understand the structure.

2. **Feature Selection** ✨:

   - We select the **Annual Income** and **Spending Score** columns to perform clustering. These features help us capture the relationship between a customer’s income and their spending behavior.

3. **Choosing the Number of Clusters** 🔢:

   - To determine the optimal number of clusters, we used the **Elbow Method**. The **Within-Cluster Sum of Squares (WCSS)** was calculated for cluster numbers ranging from 1 to 10. Based on the plot generated by the Elbow Method, we selected **5 clusters** as the optimum.

4. **Training the K-means Model** 🤖:

   - We trained the **K-means clustering** model on the selected features (`Annual Income` and `Spending Score`) using **5 clusters**. The **K-means++** initialization method was used to ensure better initialization and convergence.

5. **Cluster Visualization** 📈:

   - After training, we visualized the clusters using **Matplotlib**. Each cluster is plotted with a distinct color, and the cluster **centroids** are represented in **cyan** to denote the central points of each segment. This allows for easy interpretation of the customer segments based on their spending patterns and income levels.

## Insights and Interpretation 🔍

- The clustering algorithm divided customers into **five segments** based on their **annual income** and **spending score**.
- From the visualization, different customer groups can be identified, such as **high-income, high-spending** customers and **low-income, low-spending** customers, which can be valuable for targeted marketing.
- The **centroids** represent the average position of customers within each group, providing insight into the characteristics of each segment.

## Technologies Used 💻

- **Python** 🐍: Core language used for data analysis and visualization.
- **Pandas** and **NumPy**: Used for data manipulation and numerical operations.
- **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**: Used for data visualization, including visualizing clusters and WCSS values.
- **Scikit-Learn**: Used for applying the K-means clustering algorithm.

## Results 📊

The results of this analysis demonstrate the effectiveness of K-means clustering in segmenting customers based on their purchasing behavior. By identifying **5 distinct customer segments**, businesses can tailor their marketing strategies to better meet the needs of each group, ultimately leading to improved customer satisfaction and targeted marketing efforts.

## How to Run the Code 🖥️

To run the code in this repository:

1. **Clone** the repository.
2. Make sure you have installed the required libraries: `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, and `scikit-learn`.
3. Download the dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shwetabh123/mall-customers) and save it in the appropriate directory.
4. Execute the Python script to see the results.

## Future Enhancements 🚀

- **Feature Engineering**: Add more features such as age and gender to see if they contribute to better segmentation.
- **Dimensionality Reduction**: Use techniques like **PCA** to see if reducing dimensions improves the clustering process.
- **Different Algorithms**: Experiment with other clustering techniques, such as **DBSCAN** or **Hierarchical Clustering**, to compare results.
